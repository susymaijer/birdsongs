<h1>To Copy Sounds to Minidisc or Audio CD</h1>

<p>We were asked so many times how to transfer a playlist to CD or minidisc, that I thought I better put something on the website.</p>

<p>Playlists on the "Birds of Tropical Asia 2" CD-ROM only "play". That is to say, after pressing the "Play!" button the program only 
lets you listen to a series of recordings. So if you want to copy that sound to a minidisc, you will have to connect the Line Out 
connector on your soundcard to the Line In connector on your recorder. To put each recording on a new MD track, specifying 
a few seconds of silence between the recordings may work (this depends on your minidisc recorder).</p>

<p>If you want to make an Audio CD however, you will probably need soundfiles, not just sound. Here the playlist feature is of no help (it will 
be on a future version, just as it is now on our latest production: the "Birds of Ecuador" DVD-ROM). 
If you want to assemble the sound files yourself so that you can copy them to an audio CD, you can discover the name of
the soundfile &quot;under&quot; each sound with the Sound menu:<br>
- place the sky-blue "cursor" on a soundbar (this enables the "Sound" menu)<br>
- in the Sound menu, choose "Show sound source".</p>
