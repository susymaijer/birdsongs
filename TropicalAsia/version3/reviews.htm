<h2>Review of &quot;Birds of Tropical Asia 2&quot;</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
   <li>
      &quot;... The recordings are generally of high or very high quality, although in some cases
      less commonly recorded species have a single poorer-quality recording (e.g. the Chinese
      Leaf-Warbler <i>Phylloscopus sichuanensis</i> is marred by movement sounds). Even these
      lesser recordings are acceptable as the species are still clearly identifiable and would
      presumably otherwise be missing from the collection. As is usual with Bird Songs International products
      an enormous amount of work has gone into providing information with the tracks. Sound recordist, date,
      altitude, country, province, area and often exact location and time of recordings are given, which can be
      very useful in seeking to identify regional variations. Perhaps the greatest effort has gone into 
      giving the identity of background species for each recording and this is where the CD-ROM has a great 
      advantage over most audio CDs which have insufficient room for this useful information.&nbsp;...&quot;<br>
      ...<br>
      &quot;...&nbsp;Overall this is an excellent product and if you are interested in the birds of tropical Asia,
      and especially their sounds, this is a must to buy.&quot;--<i>Ross MacLeod & Jeremy Lindsell 
      in</i> <b>Ibis</b> 145: p. 362 - 2003.<br>
