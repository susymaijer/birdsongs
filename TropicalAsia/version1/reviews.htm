   <li>
      &quot;Birds of Tropical Asia is a very cleverly put together CD-ROM which gives a great
      insight into the audio and visual treasures of the region. (..) enhanced by the inclusion of
      some truly stunning photographs. (..) I found the set-up and running of the CD extremely
      straightforward (even without reading the instructions!) and the screen layout was very
      user-friendly. Overall, the quality of the images (many of which are in the hand) on my
      monitor was superb. Highlights for me included the tiny Rufous Piculet, barely bigger than the
      thumb next to it, the vividly coloured Rail babbler, and the Giant Pitta which seemed to be
      about to leap out of the monitor at me! There are some interesting recordings too. Listen to
      the Taiwan Shortwing to see why this one is a potential split, or the Bar-bellied Pitta to
      whet your appetite for a trip to Indochina! Equally pleasing was the inclusion of a few
      seldom-heard species such as Cinnamon-rumped Trogon and Short-toed Coucal. I was also most
      impressed by the additional information which gives geographical locations, maps, and even
      other species in the background of the recordings. There is even a facility where you can sit
      back and watch as a random series of images or sounds (or both) are flashed up in front of
      you. This can be used to test yourself, as there is an option not to display the species names
      and then review what was presented afterwards. (..) a fascinating, innovative and very well
      put together CD-ROM which sets high standards for anyone thinking of putting together a
      similar package. (..)&quot; -- <em>Pete Morris in the </em><b>Oriental Bird Club </b>(OBC)<em>
      </em><b>Bulletin</b><em> number 30, 1999.</em><br>
   <li>
      &quot;This fabulous resource is a very exciting addition to the ever-burgeoning catalogue
      of resources available for lovers of Asian birds. .. The layout is simple and easy to use, the
      species list is extensive and exciting - 21 cuckoos, 15 pheasants and partridges, 20 owls,17
      barbets, 80 babblers (!), 55 warblers and so on. As far as I know it's the most extensive
      collection of sound recording available for the area and the first available on CD-ROM. <em>Birds
      of Tropical Asia</em> covers the avifauna of an extensive area from Southern China to the
      Philippines, Indonesia to the Indian subcontinent. Not included are the Moluccas and southern
      Japan. One of my favourite features of the CD-ROM is the &quot;Slides and Sounds Show&quot;
      function, which allows the user to play a random selection of photos and sounds - this a fine
      learning tool.<br>
      .. A search option does allow the user to find the English or scientific family or species
      name or part of a name very quickly .. The location where each recording was made is given and
      clicking on these brings up a map with the location marked ... The photos are generally of a
      very high standard - I have heard at least one criticism that there are too many birds
      pictured in the hand, personally I think this is not justified and enjoyed the close up
      studies of some pretty cryptic species. ..<br>
      .. I have no hesitation in recommending the product...&quot; <em>-- Susan Myers in </em><b>Australian
      Birding</b><em>, Summer 1999.</em><br>
   <li>
      &quot;.. The images are just about all large and clear, although nearly all of the
      passerines are trapped birds in the hand. The superb collection of sound recordings will be
      even more valuable for the active birder. The CD-ROM format can hold an incredible amount,
      with each recording and/or photograph just a click or two away ...&quot; <em>-- Steve Gantlett
      in </em><b>Birding World</b><em> </em>Vol. 13, nr. 2<em>.</em><br>
   <li>
      &nbsp;.... For each recording (typically one to three per species and occasionally up to
      six), there is a sliding bar (clicking the arrow at the left starts the recording) surrounded
      by additional information: length of the recording, when and where the recording was made
      (including elevation, latitude, longitude, and a map); a letter (A to E) indicating the
      quality of the recording; a notation of the vocalization type (song, call, alarm note, etc.);
      and, if there are pictures of the selected species, a small photo which can be enlarged by
      clicking it. Background species are noted, and identification certainties for various species
      are given. Some may find that this is more information than they need, but I feel differently.
      Many species and subspecies, tropical and otherwise, have different vocalizations in different
      areas, so location information can be very important. (I wish that ABA-Area CDs and CD-ROMs
      did this!) As to the need for identification certainty ratings, I can only point out that
      inaccurate recordings of rails and marsh sparrows on well-known recordings of ABA birds have
      confused birders for decades. And, while some of our marsh birds are notorious for hiding,
      most could take secrecy lessons from rain-forest denizens. In other words, I view the
      certainty rating as overdue honesty in recognizing the difficulties of recording in the rain
      forest and in identifying areas in need of more work.<br>
      ...<br>
      ...&nbsp; the treatment and documentation of their data (especially the vocalizations) are
      among the best commercially available to date. As such, they are well worth their list price
      (...), and I only hope that Bird Songs International continues to update them and produce
      similar products for other regions.&quot;--<i>Michael R. Hannisian in</i> <b>Birding</b>
