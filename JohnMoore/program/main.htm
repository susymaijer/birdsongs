<h1>A program which integrates all CDs published by John Moore</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here is a program which plays all 9 CDs published by <a href="http://johnvmoorenaturerecordings.com" target="_blank">John
V. Moore Nature Recordings</a>. The CDs are played from your CD-/DVD-ROM drive, or you can copy them to your hard disk and 
play them from there. See the screenshot below.</p>

<p>Advantages:<br>
- the program plays exact sections within CD tracks,<br>
- the program shows all the CDs, so no searching in booklets to find which CD has which species,<br>
- when you copy the CDs to your hard disk first: all recordings are played instantly. No more playing
discjockey!</p>

<p>This program is really a by-product of the still-in-the-works DVD-ROM "Birds of Peru, Bolivia and Paraguay" (which will play
many more CDs). I put it up here because I think it may be useful for some people, and also because I hope to receive some 
feedback concerning problems, bugs, suggestions for improvement, etc.</p>

<p>To download the installation file: <a href="setup.exe">click here</a> and either download and
execute it, or run without downloading.</p>

<p>One note: the program also shows icons for photographs. Please ignore them, because
the photos are of course 
missing.</p>
