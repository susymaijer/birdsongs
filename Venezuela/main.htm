<p>In 1999, Bird Songs International proudly presented its third CD-ROM: &quot;Birds of Venezuela / Aves
de Venezuela&quot;, by Peter Boesman. This revolutionary CD-ROM contained 700 photographs, almost
1300 sound recordings (more than 7.5 hours!), and a complete set of distribution maps of 878 bird
species. Everything presented in an extremely user-friendly format: any sound recording, any photo
is seconds away, accessible by just a few keyclicks! Please read the <a href="reviews.htm">reviews</a>!</p>
<p>Contained photos and/or sounds of 10 species of Tinamous, 42 Hawks and Falcons, 11 Guans &amp;
Curassows, 31 Parrots, 24 nightbirds, 40 Hummingbirds, 13 Toucans, 57 Ovenbirds and Woodcreepers, 65
Antbirds, 122 Flycatchers and many more.</p>
<p>This CD-ROM is bilingual. At installation time one must choose between English and
Spanish (you can even install both languages!).</p>
<p><b>Peter Boesman</b> started birding in his native country Belgium when he was twelve (now
30 years ago). He studied Venezuelan birds in the field for the last ten years (of which seven years as
a resident). He discovered a wealth of new information and published several articles on Venezuelan
birds. Throughout the years, he also accumulated a large collection of sound recordings and
photographs (for several species those were the first ever obtained). Although he lived on three
different continents during the last three years, his interest stays focused on the Neotropics, and
Peter continues working on more projects with Neotropical Birds.</p>

<p> Note by Sjoerd Mayer: the 2nd edition of the CD-ROM unfortunately never appeared. At the
start of 2004 it was nearly finished, being spectacularly improved, with useful
new features, with many additional species, sound recordings and photographs,
better sound quality, and with far fewer identification errors. Then, when I
(being the publisher) asked Peter to offer co-authorship to Steven Hilty and Robert Ridgely, because he had meticulously copied the distribution
maps out of Hilty's Venezuela guide and Ridgely's &quot;The Birds of South
America&quot;, Peter responded that he would do that. But he never did (or maybe
he did, received negative replies, and didn't tell me). So that was the end of
the 2nd version! Instead, in
2006 Peter published an MP3 CD with sound recordings (which is very useful too
of course).</p> -->
