<h2 align="center">Errata of the CD-ROM &quot;Bird Sounds of
Bolivia 1.0&quot; </h2>

<p>Last update: 13 September 1999. </p>

<p>I tried my best to prevent errors, but well, here we go: </p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Starred Wood-Quail</b> <i>Odontophorus stellatus</i>.
        After listening to the fourth recording of Marbled Wood-Quail
        <i>Odontophorus gujanensis</i>&nbsp;on John V. Moore's
        new Ecuadorian Lowland Rainforest Volume 3 cassette tape,
        I must admit that the two recordings sound suspiciously
        alike! </li>
    <li><b>Great Horned Owl</b> <i>Bubo virginianus</i>. This is
        not an owl at all, but Night Monkey <i>Aotus</i> sp.! </li>
    <li><b>Squirrel Cuckoo</b> <i>Piaya cayana</i>. The calls on
        the second recording are made by a Scale-breasted
        Woodpecker <i>Celeus grammicus</i>, and not by the Cuckoo.
        John V. Moore and Paul Coopmans, thanks for drawing my
        attention to this error! </li>
    <li><b>White-throated Antbird</b> <i>Gymnopithys salvini</i>.
        The suspected alarm calls of this species (which I
        assigned a certainty of only 60%), are almost certainly
        those of Buff-throated Foliage-Gleaner <i>Automolus
        ochrolaemus</i>. </li>
    <li><b>Yellow-crowned Tyrannulet</b> <i>Tyrannulus elatus</i>.
        The second recording may be a call of a Warbling Antbird <i>Hypocnemis
        cantator</i>, according to Niels Krabbe. </li>
    <li><b>Small-billed Eleania</b> <i>Elaenia parvirostris</i>.
        Noticing that the song heard on the first recording&nbsp;is
        more or less identical to that of Highland Elaenia <i>Elaenia
        obscura</i> on this CD-ROM, and that the singing bird was
        not properly seen, I am afraid I made a mistake here. So,
        this is very probably not Small-billed, but Highland
        Elaenia. </li>
    <li><b>White-bellied Pygmy-Tyrant</b> <i>Myiornis albiventris</i>.
        Sebastian Herzog tape recorded calls of Yungas Tody-Tyrant
        <i>Hemitriccus spodiops</i>, which are identical. So I am
        afraid I made a mistake here. </li>
    <li><b>White-eyed Tody-Tyrant</b> <i>Hemitriccus zosterops</i>.
        I am afraid both recordings are of Flammulated Bamboo-Tyrant
        <i>Hemitriccus flammulatus</i>. </li>
    <li><b>Black-throated Tody-Tyrant</b> <i>Hemitriccus
        granadensis</i>. The single purring call on the CD-ROM
        may be a call of Rufous-headed Pygmy-Tyrant <i>Pseudotriccus
        ruficeps</i> after all. </li>
    <li><b>Slaty-capped Flycatcher</b> <i>Leptopogon
        superciliaris</i>. This is the song of White-throated
        Spadebill <i>Platyrinchus mystaceus</i>! This error was
        found, and the correct identification made, by Alfredo J.
        Begazo. </li>
    <li><b>Golden-crowned Spadebill </b><i>Platyrinchus coronatus</i>.
        This is very probably the song of Cinnamon-rumped Foliage-Gleaner
        <i>Philydor pyrrhodes</i>. Calls of the Foliage-Gleaner
        are conspicuous on this recordings as well (the double,
        and once triple, calls). Alfredo J. Begazo discovered
        this error, and made the correct identification. </li>
    <li><b>Olive-tufted Flycatcher </b><i>Mitrephanes olivaceus</i>.
        Sebastian Herzog discovered that these are the calls of
        an undescribed <em>Cnemotriccus</em> Flycatcher! The bird
        looks very similar to Fuscous Flycatcher <em>Cnemotriccus
        fuscater</em>, but has an entirely different voice. The
        'kipkip-kip' calls in the background remain unidentified.</li>
    <li><b>Barred Becard</b> <i>Pachyramphus versicolor</i>. Not
        an error, this one. Sebastian Herzog saw a bird while it
        was singing, and tape recorded it. Same song as on the CD-ROM,
        so the certainty becomes 100%. </li>
    <li><b>Rufous-bellied Euphonia</b> <i>Euphonia rufiventris</i>.
        I am afraid that the calls may well have been made by
        Bronze-green Euphonia <i>Euphonia mesochrysa</i>. </li>
</ul>
