<p>This new version 2.22, published in 2010, contains the same sound recordings and photos as the original version
2.0. The
differences are:<br> 
<b>A</b> - the taxonomy is updated (to <a href="http://www.museum.lsu.edu/~Remsen/SACCBaseline.html">SACC</a> in May 2010),<br>
<b>B</b> - the program is now able to convert nearly all recordings to MP3 files with complete information embedded,<br>
<b>C</b> - most of the &quot;mystery&quot; recordings and photos were solved,<br>
<b>D</b> - wrongly identified photos or sounds were either removed, or &quot;moved&quot; to the correct species,<br>
<b>E</b> - program bugs were corrected.</p>
<p>If you have version 2.0, you can have the same program as on the new version by installing it from <a href="version2/errata_e.htm">here</a>.</p>
<p><i>What follows is the text of version 2.0:</i></p>
<p>It took four years, but the second version of our Bolivian Birds CD-ROM is out, to general
acclaim (see the <a href="reviews.htm">reviews</a>) It contains 2530 sound recordings (over 19
hours, thanks to MP3 compression) of 941 bird species, all occurring in Bolivia, with accompanying
texts and identifications of all background species. And the CD-ROM now has photographs: 1390 of 756
species (639 occurring in Bolivia and an additional 117 species from northern Peru and Ecuador).</p>
<p align="left">This CD-ROM is of even more significance because so many South American birds can
only be found or identified by their voices. Good examples are the Tinamous (18 species on the
CD-ROM), Owls (25 species), Nightjars and Potoos (21 species), and those quintessential South
American bird families: the Antbirds and Ground Antbirds (92 species). Many, if not most of the
species on this CD-ROM are not found on commercially available cassette tapes or audio CDs. It has
recordings of many rare and seldom (if ever) recorded species, like Huayco Tinamou, Horned Curassow,
an unseen Screech-Owl which is either Cloud-forest Screech-Owl or an undescribed species,
White-winged Nightjar, Bolivian Spinetail, Bolivian Recurvebill, Yungas Antwren, Masked Antpitta,
two undescribed Flycatcher species, Rufous-sided Pygmy-Tyrant, Ash-breasted Tit-Tyrant,
Buff-throated Tody-Tyrant, Sharpbill, Chestnut-crested Cotinga, Yellow-shouldered Grosbeak,
Black-and-tawny Seedeater. And lots and lots more (see the <a href="specl_En.htm">species list</a>).</p>

<p>Sjoerd Mayer spent the years 1991 - 1995 exploring the high mountains and steamy jungles of
Bolivia, a country with an incredibly rich (1370 species so far, and counting!) and little-known
bird fauna. He discovered a species new to science (Bolivian Spinetail), rediscovered two species
after many years (Masked Antpitta and Ash-breasted Tit-Tyrant), and recorded more than a hundred
hours of bird vocalizations. A computer programmer by profession, he designed and wrote all software
used to produce this CD-ROM.</p>
