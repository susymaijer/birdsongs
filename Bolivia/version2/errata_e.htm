<h2>Updated program, errata, program problems of &quot;Birds of Bolivia 2.0&quot;</h2>

<p>by Sjoerd Mayer</p>

<p><b>Updated Program (current version: 2.21)</b></p>

<p><a href="../../PatchPrograms/Bolivia2EnglishUpdate.exe">Click here</a> 
to install an updated program which:<br>
- fixes program bugs,<br>
- no longer shows the erroneous sound recordings and photos (instead it shows them either with
 the correct species, or not at all),<br>
- shows the voices of some additional species (e.g. Cryptic Forest-Falcon!),<br>
- shows the &quot;solutions&quot; to many of the mystery recordings of version
2.0,<br>
- can convert all recordings to mp3 files with all information embedded,<br>
- can convert ALL (2572!) recordings to mp3s in one go! (with File/Make ALL mp3 files),<br>
- runs equally on 32-bit and 64-bit Windows.<br>
<u>Note 1:</u>   After installation, "Birds of Bolivia 2, updated version&quot; does not know in which drive
to look for the CD-ROM, and when you attempt to play a sound, it will ask you for the
folder or drive where the sound and photo files are located.<br>
<u>Note 2:</u>  This updated program does not replace the original "Birds of Bolivia 2.0" program (the one on the
CD-ROM). To remove the original program, see Help/Read Me.<br>
<u>Note 3:</u> This updated program replaces versions 2.1 etc.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Errata of version 2.0</b></p>

<ul>
    <li>The bird on the first photo of <strong>Lesser Yellow-headed Vulture</strong> <i>Cathartes burrovianus</i> 
        is actually a Greater Yellow-headed Vulture <i>Cathartes melambrotus</i>, as pointed out by Dan Lane
        <a href="mailto:barbetboy@yahoo.com">barbetboy@yahoo.com</a>) in February 2005.
    <li>The bird on the photo of <strong>Hook-billed Kite</strong> <i>Chondrohierax uncinatus</i> is a Roadside Hawk
      <i>Buteo magnirostris</i>, as pointed out by Joe Tobias
        (<a href="mailto:joetobias22@hotmail.com">joetobias22@hotmail.com</a>) in July 2004.
    <li>The bird on the photos of <strong>Double-toothed Kite</strong> <i>Harpagus bidentatus</i> is
      also a Roadside Hawk <i>Buteo magnirostris</i>, as pointed out by Dan Lane
        <a href="mailto:barbetboy@yahoo.com">barbetboy@yahoo.com</a>) in February 2005.
    <li>The bird on the photo of <strong>Swainson's Hawk</strong> <i>Buteo swainsoni</i> is
      actually a Red-tailed Hawk <i>Buteo jamaicensis</i>, as pointed out by Sidney Dunkle in June 2006 
      (and by Joe Tobias before that, but I forgot to follow up on it).
<!--
    <li>The song of <strong>Blue-throated Piping-Guan</strong> <i>Pipile pipile</i> is actually the song of
        <strong>Scale-backed Antbird</strong> <i>Hylophylax poecilinotus</i>. Pointed out by
        Joe Tobias (<a href="mailto:joetobias22@hotmail.com">joetobias22@hotmail.com</a>) in January 2004.
-->        
    <li>The chick of <strong>Marbled Wood-Quail</strong> <i>Odontophorus gujanensis</i> is actually one
        of the <i>Tinamus</i> Tinamous. This was discovered by Mark Pearman (<a href="mailto:mpearman@infovia.com.ar">mpearman@infovia.com.ar</a>),
        and confirmed by Jon Fjeldså ("Palaeognathous birds (= ostriches, rheas, tinamous etc) can immediately be recognized by 
        the position of the gape, as the roof of the upper mandible is continuous with the palate of the skull, while in all other 
        birds there is an angle between the plane of bill and skull. In addition the skull is so much more slender than in 
        <i>Odontophorus</i>"). Erratum added in October 2002.</li>
    <li><u>Not an error</u>, but listed here anyway: The <strong>... Screech-Owl</strong> <i>Otus sp.</i>
    	 was collected by Sebastian Herzog, Aidan Maccormick, Ross MacLeod, and others in August/September 2001, 
    	 and (as expected) turned out to be <strong>Cloudforest Screech-Owl</strong> <i>Otus marshalli</i>, a new
    	 species for Bolivia.
<!--
    <li>The bird on the photo of <strong>Little Nightjar</strong> <i>Caprimulgus parvulus</i> is not that species (look at its 
        long tail). It may well be a <strong>Pauraque</strong> <i>Nyctidromus albicollis</i>.
        It was Mark Pearman (<a href="mailto:mpearman@infovia.com.ar">mpearman@infovia.com.ar</a>) who remarked on this.</li>
-->        
    <li>The bird on the photos of <strong>Scrub Nightjar</strong> <i>Caprimulgus anthonyi</i> is not that species, but
      a female of the small
        coastal form <i>decussatus</i> of Band-winged Nightjar <i>Caprimulgus longirostris</i>. This was brought to
        my attention by Daniel Lane (<a href="mailto:barbetboy@yahoo.com">barbetboy@yahoo.com</a>).
      June 2003.
    <li>The birds heard on the first recording of <strong>Scissor-tailed Nightjar</strong> <i>Hydropsalis torquata</i> were
        very probably not that species, but two displaying Black-collared Hawks <i>Busarellus nigricollis</i>!
        Thomas Stuart (<a href="mailto:thomtail@hotmail.com">thomtail@hotmail.com</a>) told me this.
      July 2002.
    <li>The bird on the photos of <strong>Band-tailed Barbthroat</strong> <i>Threnetes ruckeri</i> is an immature
      Green-crowned Brilliant <i>Heliodoxa jacula</i>, as pointed out by Joe Tobias
        (<a href="mailto:joetobias22@hotmail.com">joetobias22@hotmail.com</a>)
      in January 2002.
    <li>The bird on the photo of <strong>Rufous-throated Sapphire </strong><em>Hylocharis
        sapphirina</em> (which already had the comment "No 100% certainty") is actually a Sapphire-spangled Emerald <i>Amazilia/Polyerata lactea</i>, 
        as pointed out by A. Bennett Hennessey (<a href="mailto:tangara@unete.com">tangara@unete.com</a>)
      in June 2001.</li>
    <li>The photos of <strong>White-chinned Sapphire </strong><em>Hylocharis cyanus</em>:<br>
        - the bird on the second photo ("A female. August 1996.") is actually a 
        Sapphire-spangled Emerald <em>Amazilia lactea</em>.<br>
        - the bird on the last two photos (which had the comment "The identification is tentative") is actually a 
        female Gilded Sapphire <em>Hylocharis chrysura</em>.<br>
        All this was pointed out by Joe Tobias (<a href="mailto:joetobias22@hotmail.com">joetobias22@hotmail.com</a>) 
        in April 2005.</li>
    <li>The bird on the second photo of <strong>White-bellied Hummingbird</strong> <i>Amazilia chionogaster</i> is a young
        Hillstar <i>Oreotrochilus</i> sp., as pointed out by Joe Tobias
        (<a href="mailto:joetobias22@hotmail.com">joetobias22@hotmail.com</a>)
      in August 2003.
    <li>The bird on the 3 photos of <strong>Glittering-throated Emerald</strong> <i>Amazilia fimbriata</i>
         (which already had the comment "not 100% certain"), 
        is a female White-necked Jacobin <i>Florisuga mellivora</i>, as pointed out by Joe Tobias
        (<a href="mailto:joetobias22@hotmail.com">joetobias22@hotmail.com</a>) in July 2004.
    <li>The second photo of <strong>Green-crowned Brilliant</strong> <i>Heliodoxa jacula</i> is of a female, not an immature.</li>
    <li>The bird on the photo of <strong>Viridian Metaltail </strong><em>Metallura williami</em> 
        is actually a Neblina Metaltail <i>M. odomae</i>. July 2003.</li>
    <li>The bird on the photo of <strong>Black-eared Fairy</strong> <em>Heliothryx aurita</em> 
        is actually a female Horned Sungem <i>Heliactin bilophus</i>. 
        Pointed out by Rasmus Boegh (<a href="mailto:rasmus_boegh@yahoo.dk">rasmus_boegh@yahoo.dk</a>) in July 2005.</li>
    <li>The bird on the photo of <strong>Violaceous Trogon </strong><em>Trogon violaceus</em> is actually a Black-headed Trogon <em>Trogon melanocephalus</em>, as pointed out by Jon Hornbuckle (<a
        href="mailto:JonHornbu@aol.com">JonHornbu@aol.com</a>) in May 2001.</li>
<!--
    <li>Regarding the photo of a "nesting colony" of <strong>Ringed Kingfisher</strong> <em>Ceryle torquata</em>, Dan Lane wrote in
        February 2005: ".. photo of "nesting colony"??? I am unaware of them nesting in colonies! More likely some kind 
        of swallow or Chelidoptera.".
-->    
    <li>The second recording of <strong>Emerald Toucanet</strong> <em>Aulacorhynchus prasinus</em>
        (unseen, 99%), recorded at Sajta, is actually a singing Gray-headed Kite <em>Leptodon cayanensis</em>!
        Discovered by Dan Lane (<a href="mailto:barbetboy@yahoo.com">barbetboy@yahoo.com</a>). February 2005.    
    <li>The "alarm calls" of <strong>Long-tailed Woodcreeper </strong><em>Deconychura
        longicauda</em>, which I gave a certainty of 99%, were almost certainly made by Plain-brown Woodcreeper
        <em>Dendrocincla fuliginosa</em>, judging from
        a recording of that species on Cornell's CD "Voices of Amazonian Birds", Volume 2.</li>
    <li>The first, third and maybe the fourth photos of <strong>Long-tailed Woodcreeper</strong> <em>Deconychura
        longicauda</em>, show Plain-brown Woodcreeper <em>Dendrocincla fuliginosa</em>, 
        according to Daniel Lane in April 2005.</li>
    <li>The photo of <strong>Striped Woodcreeper</strong> <em>Xiphorhynchus obsoletus</em>
      probably shows a Tschudi's Woodcreeper <em>Xiphorhynchus chunchotambo</em> 
        ("its bill is not sufficiently stubby, nor is the curve of its lower mandible sufficiently smooth, 
        for Striped Woodcreeper (...) Moreover, the unbordered thin pale streak visible on the upperparts 
        is again indicative of Tschudi's .." - e-mail from Joe Tobias).
        Found by Daniel Lane and Joe Tobias at the end of May 2005.</li>
    <li>The fourth recording of <strong>Spix's Woodcreeper</strong> <em>Xiphorhynchus spixii</em> has only in the beginning the song/call
        of that species. After that it is a Rufous-tailed Jacamar <em>Galbula ruficauda</em> which (almost seamlessly!) 
        takes over.
        Noticed by Joe Tobias (<a href="mailto:joetobias22@hotmail.com">joetobias22@hotmail.com</a>) in January 2002, but only
      (grudgingly) accepted
        by me in July 2004.</li>
    <li>The songs on the second recording of <strong>Montane Woodcreeper </strong><em>Lepidocolaptes
        lacrymiger</em>, which I gave a certainty of 99%, were made by either 
        Reddish Hermit<em> Phaethornis ruber</em> or White-browed Hermit <em>Phaethornis stuarti</em>,
        as pointed out by Joe Tobias
        (<a href="mailto:joetobias22@hotmail.com">joetobias22@hotmail.com</a>) in September 2004.</li>
    <li>The second recording ("Song") of <strong>Cabanis' Spinetail</strong> <i>Synallaxis cabanisi</i> is not of that species, but
    	 are calls of what was almost certainly a White-throated Spadebill <i>Platyrinchus mystaceus</i>. Pointed out by
    	 Paul Coopmans (<a href="mailto:coopmans@ecnet.ec">coopmans@ecnet.ec</a>), and confirmed by the recordist Sebastian Herzog
        (<a href="mailto:skherzog@compuserve.com">skherzog@compuserve.com</a>).
      May 2003.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>The fourth recording ("Calls", 99%) of <strong>Gray Antbird</strong> <em>Cercomacra cinerascens</em>
        contains actually calls of Plain Antvireo <em>Dysithamnus mentalis</em>.
        Found by Dan Lane
        <a href="mailto:barbetboy@yahoo.com">barbetboy@yahoo.com</a>) in April 2005.</li>
    <li>The songs on the third recording of <strong>Spot-backed Antbird</strong> <i>Hylophylax naevia</i> were
        probably made by Masked Gnatcatcher <i>Polioptila dumicola</i>. 
        "Solved" with help from Bret Whitney. January 2004.</li>
    <li>The second part of the recording of song of <strong>Stripe-headed Antpitta</strong> <em>Grallaria andicola</em> is actually a 
        singing Ancash Tapaculo <em>Scytalopus affinis</em>, I was told by the recordist Niels
      Krabbe in October 2002.
    <li>The singing bird on the 11th recording of <strong>Southern Beardless-Tyrannulet</strong> 
        <em>Camptostoma obsoletum</em> (which had a certainty of only 95%), is actually a
        <strong>Brown Jacamar</strong> <em>Brachygalba lugubris</em>! 
        Found by Dan Lane
        <a href="mailto:barbetboy@yahoo.com">barbetboy@yahoo.com</a>) in April 2005.</li>
    <li>The bird on the photo of <strong>Tawny-rumped Tyrannulet </strong><em>Phyllomyias uropygialis</em> is actually a female Andean
        Tyrant <em>Knipolegus signatus</em>, as pointed out by Alvaro Jaramillo (<a
        href="mailto:alvaro@sirius.com">alvaro@sirius.com</a>) in August 2000.</li>
    <li>The bird on the photos of <strong>Brownish Flycatcher</strong> <em>Cnipodectes subbrunneus</em> is not that species, but almost
        certainly a Thrush-like Schiffornis <i>Schiffornis turdinus</i>. 
        Mark Pearman (<a href="mailto:mpearman@infovia.com.ar">mpearman@infovia.com.ar</a>) was the first to express doubts about
        this bird (in July 2002), and it was Dan Lane (<a href="mailto:barbetboy@yahoo.com">barbetboy@yahoo.com</a>) who then "solved" the
      case in November 2002.</li>
    <li>The bird on the photo of <strong>White Monjita</strong> <em>Xolmis irupero</em> is actually a Black-backed Water-Tyrant
        <em>Fluvicola albiventer</em>, as pointed out by Adrián Azpiroz (<a href="mailto:avesuru@adinet.com.uy">avesuru@adinet.com.uy</a>)
      in August 2000.</li>
    <li>The bird on the first photo of <strong>White-eyed Attila</strong> <i>Attila bolivianus</i> is actually a
        rufous morph Bright-rumped Attila <i>Attila spadiceus</i>, as pointed out by Dan Lane
        <a href="mailto:barbetboy@yahoo.com">barbetboy@yahoo.com</a>) in February 2005.
    <li>The bird on the photo of <strong>Lesser Kiskadee</strong> <i>Philohydor lictor</i> is actually a
        Great Kiskadee <i>Pitangus sulphuratus</i>, as pointed out by Joe Tobias
        (<a href="mailto:joetobias22@hotmail.com">joetobias22@hotmail.com</a>) in August 2003.
    <li>The first photo of <strong>Rusty-margined Flycatcher</strong> <em>Myiozetetes cayanensis</em> was made at
        Bilsa, Ecuador, and not in the Beni Biological Station, Bolivia. May 2004.</li>
    <li>The bird on the photo of <strong>Tropical Kingbird</strong> <em>Tyrannus melancholicus</em> is actually a Cattle Tyrant <em>Machetornis rixosus</em>, as pointed out by Mark Pearman
        (<a href="mailto:mpearman@infovia.com.ar">mpearman@infovia.com.ar</a>)
      in July 2002.</li>
    <li>The calls of <strong>Scarlet-breasted Fruiteater</strong> <em>Pipreola frontalis</em>
        are not of that species, but were made by Hazel-fronted Pygmy-Tyrant
        <em>Pseudotriccus simplex</em>. This was pointed out to me by Sebastian Herzog
        (<a href="mailto:skherzog@compuserve.com">skherzog@compuserve.com</a>) in 2000.</li>
    <li>The recording of "calls" of <strong>Varzea Mourner</strong> <em>Schiffornis major</em> is wrong: this is
        actually a singing Troupial <em>Icterus icterus</em>, as pointed out by Wim ten Have 
        (<a href="mailto:info@tanagertours.com">info@tanagertours.com</a>) in January 2002.</li>
    <li>The third photo of <strong>Sulphur-bellied Tyrant-Manakin</strong> <em>Neopelma sulphureiventer</em>
        (which the accompanying text already found doubtful), depicts actually a
        Band-tailed Manakin <em>Pipra fasciicauda</em>.
        Pointed out by Dan Lane <a href="mailto:barbetboy@yahoo.com">barbetboy@yahoo.com</a>) in April 2005.</li>    
    <li>The third photo of <strong>Fawn-breasted Wren</strong> <em>Thryothorus guarayanus</em> is (of course) actually a 
        House Wren <em>Troglodytes aedon</em>, as pointed out by Dan Lane
        <a href="mailto:barbetboy@yahoo.com">barbetboy@yahoo.com</a>) in February 2005.</li>    
    <li>The photo of <strong>Bluish Flowerpiercer</strong> <em>Diglossa caerulescens</em> 
        is actually a Masked Flowerpiercer <i>D. cyanea</i>. Pointed out by
        Niels Krabbe in August 2003.</li>
    <li>The split of <b>Southern</b> and <b>Northern (Blue-winged) Mountain-Tanager</b> <i>Anisognathus flavinuchus</i> and 
        <i>A. somptuosus</i> turns out to be very premature. Although I suspect that the two forms are better considered 
        separate species, with their completely different songs and disjunct distributions, nothing definite has been published yet.</li>
    <li>The young bird on the second photo of <strong>Saffron-crowned Tanager</strong><em>Tangara xanthocephala</em> 
        is actually a juv. Flame-faced Tanager <i>T. parzudakii</i>. Pointed out by Niels Krabbe in August 2003.</li>
    <li>The second (uncertain - 90%) recording of <strong>Brown-capped Redstart</strong> <em>Myioborus brunniceps</em>
        contains the song of what was probably Band-tailed Fruiteater <em>Pipreola
      intermedia</em>. May 2006. (in 2004 I thought it was probably the song of Scarlet-breasted Fruiteater <em>Pipreola frontalis frontalis</em>,
      until I came upon a recording by Jonas Nilsson of what was probably
      Band-tailed F.)&nbsp;</li>
    <li>The bird on the photo of <strong>Velvet-fronted Grackle</strong> <i>Lampropsar tanagrinus</i> is not that species, but
        a male Shiny Cowbird <i>Molothrus bonariensis</i>. 
        Discovered by Dan Lane (<a href="mailto:barbetboy@yahoo.com">barbetboy@yahoo.com</a>). February 2005.
    <li>The bird on the third recording of <b>Band-tailed Sierra-Finch</b> <i>Phrygilus alaudinus</i> ("Song during nuptial flight") was
        probably a Short-billed Pipit <i>Anthus furcatus</i>. March 2003.</li>
    <li>The last two photos of <b>Black-masked Finch</b> <i>Coryphaspiza melanotis</i>, of a juvenile,
      which according to the comment 
        is "not 100% certain", is probably a juvenile Wedge-tailed Grass-Finch <i>Emberizoides herbicola</i>.
        Pointed out by Joe Tobias (<a href="mailto:joetobias22@hotmail.com">joetobias22@hotmail.com</a>) 
        in January 2005.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Program problems of version 2.0</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>(this problem was solved in version 2.13)<br>
      If the name of the sound editing program in the Options dialog box is a long filename, you
      can either:<br>
      - enter its short file name equivalent (examples:
      c:\Progra~1\cool2000\cool2000.exe,
      c:\Progra~1\adobe\auditi~1.0\audition.exe, or c:\Progra~1\Window~2\Wmplayer.exe)<br>
      - or put &quot;&quot; around it (example: &quot;c:\Program Files\cool2000\cool2000.exe&quot;).<br>
      The updated program accepts long filenames from version 2.13.</li>
     <li>(this bug was fixed in version 2.12)<br>
      A "range check error" often occurs when Windows has been running for a
      long time (I myself started experiencing it when I began using the
      Hibernate feature, instead of always shutting down at night and rebooting
      in the morning).</li>
