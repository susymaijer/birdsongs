<h2>Review of &quot;Birds of Ecuador / Aves de Ecuador&quot;</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
   <li>
      &quot; ...<br>
      ... That there are 1,184 species represented perhaps tells you enough about the value of this
      archive, but I wish particularly to stress that many rare or poorly known species are included on the
      disc, and that the authors have managed to visit most every topographic feature of the Ecuadorian Andes,
      so that the geographic coverage for many species is outstanding. Niels Krabbe is, of course, one of the
      world's authorities on tapaculos (Rhinocryptidae), and they are especially well represented (e.g. 111
      recordings of Blackish Tapaculo [<i>Scytalopus latrans</i>] from every part of Andean Ecuador), while the
      18 recordings of the taxonomically interesting Masked-Highland Trogon (<i>Trogon personatus-temperatus</i>)
      complex are a further example of how this is a scientifically valuable archive as well as a simple tool
      for learning basic bird calls.<br>
      &nbsp;As a matter of personal taste, I appreciate what I might term the "honest presentation" of this 
      archive, which particularly means openness, disclosure, and naturalness (and does not imply "dishonesty" 
      in other products!). If there was uncertainty about the identity of the bird, this is shown, and recordings
      that were made in response to playback are so labeled. Recordings have generally not been scrubbed to
      remove the background noise of roosters, other birds, and some of the meters of falling rain (and when
      a recording was enhanced, that is indicated); nor have intervals been shortened without notice.
      Also, I prefer this products's lack of voice annotations to introduce cuts, but of course many prefer
      otherwise. There are mistakes (so far about a dozen found by the authors and listeners), helpfully
      listed on an errata page of the publisher's web site
      (<a href="errata_e.htm">link</a>), which also includes a patch program that will correct these errors
      and make a few tiny changes to the basic program.<br>
      ...<br>
      &nbsp;I highly recommend this DVD to anyone interested in the vocalizations of South American birds,
      especially in the tropical Andes. It can well serve an individual who simply wishes to learn the
      typical vocalizations of more than 1,100 species, and it is essential for individuals and institutions
      with strong interests in the songs of South American birds, especially the taxonomic implications of
      geographic variation in vocalizations. It, and other collections published by Bird Songs International,
      should also inspire other recordists to consider the ways in which technological advances make it
      possible to provide personal archives to a broad public.

      &quot;... This DVD uses modern technology to great advantage by placing the vocalizations of 
      the vast majority of Ecuadorian birds on your computer and at your fingertips. The DVD is 
      organized taxonomically by family. Clicking on a family brings up a species list with icons 
      that indicate whether a photograph or sound track is available for a given species. Clicking 
      on the species brings up a small image of the photograph (if available) and lists the sound 
      recordings available. For some species, there is information on taxonomy or recent splits. 
      Many recordings may be available for each species, and if appropriate, they are separated 
      by subspecies. Information under the sound bar for each selection includes a rating of the 
      quality of the recording, the type of vocalization (song, call, duet, etc.) and whether the 
      vocalization was recorded under natural conditions or after playback. Yet another click on the 
      twistee under the sound bar brings up complete information on the recording, including the 
      recordist, location, date, time of day, archive or reference information, and often the 
      identification of other species heard in the recording. The location where it was recorded is 
      a clickable link that takes you to two maps showing Ecuador and South America, with the 
      recording location indicated by a dot on the maps.<br>
      &nbsp; I had no trouble using the &quot;Playlist&quot; feature to create playlists for various 
      geographical regions of Ecuador. Creating a playlist involves dragging and dropping recordings 
      to the list. Playing the list requires one click. As the list is played, the species’ twistee 
      opens, showing all recordings on the list for that species, and, as each recording is played, 
      the information on that cut is displayed. Once a playlist is created, the program will build 
      a folder of the selections that may be copied to other media for use in whatever software 
      the owner has on their computer. Again, this is straightforward, and creating the folder to 
      use for burning a CD is easy.<br>
      ...<br>
      &nbsp; This product includes 69 hours of vocalizations of the birds of Ecuador. It will be 
      extremely useful to field biologists and birders who want to learn the vocalizations of these 
      species. This DVD is highly recommended.&quot; -- <i>Mary Gustafson in</i>  <b>Wilson
