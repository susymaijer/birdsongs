<h1>About Bird Songs International</h1>

<p>Bird Songs International BV was founded in the Netherlands in 1996. It was formed by Sjoerd Mayer and Bernard Geling
to publish Sjoerd's CD-ROM <a href="Bolivia/version1/homepage.htm">Bird Sounds of Bolivia / Sonidos de Aves de Bolivia 1.0</a>. 
Heartened by its good reception, we continued to publish <a href="TropicalAsia/version1/main.htm">Birds of Tropical
Asia</a> by Jelle Scharringa and its successors <a href="TropicalAsia/version2.0/main.htm">Birds of Tropical Asia 2</a>
and <a href="TropicalAsia/main.htm">Birds of Tropical Asia 3</a>, Peter Boesman's <a href="Venezuela/main.htm">Birds of Venezuela / Aves de
Venezuela</a>, the second version of the Bolivia CD-ROM <a href="Bolivia/main.htm">Birds of Bolivia / Aves de Bolivia 2.0</a>,
and <a href="Ecuador/main.htm">Birds of Ecuador / Aves de Ecuador</a> by Niels Krabbe and Jonas Nilsson.</p>

<p>In 2000 we started adding other bird sound publications to our shop.
It didn't take long until we offered a very wide range of bird sound CDs,
cassettes and CD-ROMs, covering the whole world.</p>

<!--
<p>Bernard Geling left in 2004 and started his own shop with bird sounds stuff.</p>
-->

<!--
<p>With visitor numbers to our website increasing, we thought it could be a good idea to start selling 
nature sound productions from other publishers as well. So we went
buying things from around the world, and put them on display in our internet shop.</p>
-->

<p>Everything went smoothly: the shop was a money spinner, the customers were
happy, and so were we. Or so I thought. So when I made a detailed and mutually
beneficial proposal for
Bernard for him to buy my 80% of the shares (I was going to receive a
disability &quot;pension&quot; from 2005 onwards because of my illness), I
expected it to be the start of talks between us about my proposal, price,
conditions, etc. That was in July 2004. Instead he went
practically silent, and left me completely in the dark about what he was up to.
Eventually, without any warning (except saying one
day in a mysterious voice, when I asked why he was
behaving so strangely: &quot;I know what I am doing&quot;), at the end of 2004 Bernard Geling forced me to buy his shares in the company,
took a big chunk of our inventory with him (despite signing an agreement that he
would hand over everything, in return for me buying his shares), and 
started his own shop with bird sounds stuff. So much for 30-year
friendships!&nbsp;In July 2005 he sent me a note
telling me why he
did it: &quot;advisers&quot; told him to, without naming them (a better explanation
emerges from the following:
a few years ago Annemiek -his partner- told me she was surprised that
Bernard and I were getting along so well for already such a long time. I asked
why. &quot;Because&quot;, she said, &quot;he always ends up fighting with
everybody&quot;). I hope that you, mr./mrs. visitor, don't have someone like Bernard
Geling among your friends.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I am ill with multiple sclerosis (I'm in a wheelchair, my hands are getting worse, 
I'm tired like a dog most of the time, and all that). So thus came an end to a wonderful little enterprise, 
a one-day-of-work-a-week, EUR 25,000 profit a year, smoothly running little
money machine. Bernard's
actions forced me to run 
it single-handedly in 2005 (quite literally, as the MS already made my left hand half-limp. Fortunately my wife Nieves
helped me pack the boxes), but I had to wind the enterprise down, otherwise I would have lost the pension entirely
(having lost it already in 2005, because of too much profit).
Fortunately I managed to wind it down in an elegant way: I sold my inventory to 
<a href="http://www.wildsounds.co.uk/"><b>Wildsounds</b></a> 
in August 2005, and I closed the shop completely in December.</p>

<!--
<p>Bernard's betrayal was a traumatic experience for me. Even now (October 2007), almost three years later, 
it frequently comes back when I lay awake at night (which is often because the MS gives me constant leg cramps). 
To be so deceived, lied to, and stolen from by someone I considered a good friend for over thirty years, never before did I 
live through something even remotely like it. As the saying goes (in Dutch anyway): "A misfortune never comes alone", 
so it was here: struck down by multiple sclerosis, beaten up by Bernard Geling.</p>
